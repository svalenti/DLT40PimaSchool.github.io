\section{Introcuction to Shell terminal}
The shell is a program where users can type commands. With the shell, it’s possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling software or simple commands that create an empty directory with only one line of code. The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne Again SHell — so-called because it’s derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne). Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.

Using the shell will take some effort and some time to learn. While a GUI presents you with choices to select, CLI choices are not automatically presented to you, so you must learn a few commands like new vocabulary in a language you’re studying. However, unlike a spoken language, a small number of “words” (i.e. commands) gets you a long way, and we’ll cover those essential few today.

The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of commands can be written into a script, improving the reproducibility of workflows.

In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers. Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources including high-performance computing systems. As clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching, being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill. We can build on the command-line skills covered here to tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges.

Let’s get started.

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a \emph{prompt}, indicating that the shell is waiting for input.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{figures/bash.png}
\caption{bash prompt}
\end{figure}

The shell typically uses \$ as the prompt, but may use a different symbol. In the examples for this lesson, we’ll show the prompt as \$ . Most importantly: when typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources, do not type the prompt, only the commands that follow it. Also note that after you type a command, you have to press the Enter key to execute it.

The prompt is followed by a text cursor, a character that indicates the position where your typing will appear. The cursor is usually a flashing or solid block, but it can also be an underscore or a pipe. You may have seen it in a text editor program, for example.

So let’s try our first command, ls which is short for listing. This command will list the contents of the current directory:

\begin{figure}[!]
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{figures/ls.png}
\caption{ls command}
\end{figure}



The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories is called the file system. It organizes our data into files, which hold information, and directories (also called ‘folders’), which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories. To start exploring them, we’ll go to our open shell window.

First let’s find out where we are by running a command called \emph{pwd} (which stands for ‘print working directory’). Directories are like places - at any time while we are using the shell we are in exactly one place, called our current working directory. Commands mostly read and write files in the current working directory, i.e. ‘here’, so knowing where you are before running a command is important. pwd shows you where you are:

\begin{figure}[!]
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{figures/pwd.png}
\caption{pwd command}
\end{figure}

Here, the computer’s response is \emph{/Users/nelle}, which is Nelle’s home directory:
The home directory path will look different on different operating systems. On Linux it may look like /home/nelle, and on Windows it will be similar to C:\slash Documents and Settings\slash nelle or C:\slash Users \slash nelle. (Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.) In future examples, we’ve used Mac output as the default - Linux and Windows output may differ slightly, but should be generally similar.

We will also assume that your pwd command returns your users home directory. If pwd returns something different you may need to navigate there using \emph{cd} or some commands in this lesson will not work as written. 
See Exploring Other Directories for more details on the cd command.

\caption{cd command}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[!]

\caption{command to go up one directory}
\end{figure}


Let’s create a new directory called \emph{pimaschool} using the command (which has no output):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
mkdir pima 
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[!]
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{figures/mkdirpima.png}

\section{Starting a Jupyter notebook}
This course will make extensive use of the Jupyter Notebook interface to Scientific Python, whichis  well  suited  to  academic  work  (including  independent  research)  because  it  combines  code  withoutput in digestable chunks.  Even when the end product is a polished piece of software, much of the development occurs in the sort of interactive sessions that Jupyter Notebooks provide.\\

After following the software installation instructions on the course website, activate the pima environment with:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ conda activate pima
\end{lstlisting}

Then, navigate to a working directory for this session, and start the notebook with:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ jupyter notebook
\end{lstlisting}

This should start the Jupyter Notebook server and open a client in your web browser.  An example starting a Jupyter Notebook from Linux is shown in Fig. 1.1.

\begin{figure}[!]
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{figures/start_jupyter.png}
\end{figure}

You should create one new Jupyter Notebook, by choosing the New (Python 3) option in your client.  Change the name of your notebook to something that clearly identifies what we are doing.  Start each notebook with comments (starting with “\#” symbol) indicating the title of the notebook.  See the first cell of Fig. xx for an example.  This first cell is also a good place to issue the ipython “magic function”: \%{} pylab inline which will setup the notebook for inline plots and load the numpy and matplotlib libraries for you.

\begin{figure}[!]
\includegraphics[scale=.45]{figures/notebook.png}
\caption{empty notebook}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!]
\includegraphics[scale=.45]{figures/notebook_create_file.png}
\caption{make new python 3 file in notebook}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!]
\includegraphics[scale=.45]{figures/helloworld.png}
\caption{notebook "hello world"}
\end{figure}

Now that we have made our first notebook we can save it and it will have ipynb extension.


\subsection{notebook fast command}
Here we report some short command for notebook:

{\bf Control vs Edit modes}
\begin{itemize}
\item esc for control mode
\item a : insert a new cell above current cell
\item b : insert a new cell below current cell
\item d+d : delete current cell
\item m : convert cell to markdown
\item y : convert cell to code
\item enter for edit mode
\item shift+enter : execute cell
\end{itemize}

{ \bf Code vs Markdown Cells}
\begin{itemize}
\item Markdown:
\subitem bullets
\subitem headings
\subitem equations
\subitem links
\subitem very simiar to HTML
\end{itemize}
{\bf Navigating the notebook}
\begin{itemize}
\item plus : add a new cell
\item File - Save and Checkpoint or picture of floppy drive: save
\item Close browser window and type ctl+c twice in command line : Exit
\end{itemize}
