    "# Packages in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the power of a programming language is in its packages. General tools are built into Python, specialized tools built up from these basic units live in packages that can be called upon when needed. You can think of a package as a collection of files (called modules) that contains functions for use by other programs. Note the term library is simply a generic term for a bunch of code that was designed with the aim of being usable by many applications. Often Python packages are called Python libraries. Very complex packages like NumPy have hundreds of individual modules so putting them into a directory-like structure keeps things organized and avoids name collisions. A program must import a package module before using it. Then refer to things from the module as module_name.thing_name. Python uses . to mean “part of”. The ”dot notation” is used to call a specific module inside package.\n",
